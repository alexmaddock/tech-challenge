# Code Challenge

## Quality Engineering Principles

- Prevention over goalkeeping
- Risk based test coverage over systematic test coverage
- Testing skill over test detail
- Automation over manual (as much as possible)
- Fail as a team over Success as an individual
- Continuous Improvement over big bang changes

## Instruction for you mission:

Fork this project, and provide your own github or bitbucket repository.
Setup this project with all the libraries you needed to set a testing framework
Make sure you work on a feature branch , not on master.
Naming convention for the feature branch should be "feature/<YourName-QloyalCodeTest>".
Once you are complete push code to the feature branch only.
Use best practices to write code which you follow in your day to day development.

## Your mission

- Try to complete as much as possible with in **2 days** base on the **Role you are applying**
- Ensure you provide a ***README.md*** file explaining how to run your code and the **ROLE that you are applying for**
- **Avoid using .docx** files (this is not easy to read on git repositories)

### REST API

Go to URL : https://www.weatherbit.io/api/swaggerui/weather-api-v2#/

- AC1. I want to get Current Weather Data for multiple places in the world base on Lat and Lon
- AC2. I want to get Current Weather Data for multiple places in the world base on PostCode

    - 1 point per test case executed
    - 2 points per Bug found and Documented

Provide a reports of the exucution and any bugs found ( be creative )


### WEB

Go to URL : http://phptravels.com/demo/

Create an automated smoke test suite using http://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/ or your framework of choice (Java preferred) for the below ACs
